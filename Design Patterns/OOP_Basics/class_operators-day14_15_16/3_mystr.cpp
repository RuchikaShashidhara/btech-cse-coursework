/*
We can overload the assignment operator
By providing our own semantics by replacing the default shallow copy assignment operator with the function operator=()
*/

/*
Writing our own assignment operator, that replaces the default assignment operator 
Ex: s2 = s3; now becomes s2.operator=(s3);

In operator=() function, we pass the object s3 as an argument & objects are always passed by reference. Hence, operator signature should become operator(const MyStr&) with parameter having reference to class MyStr. Here RHS of assignment is normally not expected to change, unless there is a concept of ownership. Since it is not expected to change, the parameter becomes const MyStr&
Here assignment is a case of overloading
*/

/*
Hence in the implementation of operator=(); we need not do anything if a case of self assignment is seen i.e. when this, &rhs point to the same object s4 p_.

We can compare this with &rhs as it will lead to the same reference, but we canâ€™t compare *this with rhs as it will lead to the same object and it leads to a compile-time error as here in MyStr class there is no operator defined as ==.
